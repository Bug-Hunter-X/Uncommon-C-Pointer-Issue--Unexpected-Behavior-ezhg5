This repository demonstrates a subtle yet significant error related to pointer usage in C. The bug.c file contains code that modifies an integer variable via a pointer, which may or may not exhibit the expected behavior depending on compiler optimizations and other factors. The bugSolution.c file provides a corrected version which makes the behavior explicit and reliable. The key takeaway is to carefully consider how pointers interact with variables and ensure they always point to valid, allocated memory to prevent undefined behavior and potential crashes.
